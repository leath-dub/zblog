# Strike-Through

With the flag `MD_FLAG_STRIKETHROUGH`, MD4C enables extension for recognition
of strike-through spans.

Strike-through text is any text wrapped in one or two tildes (`~`).

```````````````````````````````` example
~Hi~ Hello, world!
.
<p><del>Hi</del> Hello, world!</p>
.
--fstrikethrough
````````````````````````````````

If the length of the opener and closer doesn't match, the strike-through is
not recognized.

```````````````````````````````` example
This ~text~~ is curious.
.
<p>This ~text~~ is curious.</p>
.
--fstrikethrough
````````````````````````````````

Too long tilde sequence won't be recognized:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo ~~~bar~~~
.
<p>foo ~~~bar~~~</p>
.
--fstrikethrough
````````````````````````````````

Also note the markers cannot open a strike-through span if they are followed
with a whitespace; and similarly, then cannot close the span if they are
preceded with a whitespace:

```````````````````````````````` example
~foo ~bar
.
<p>~foo ~bar</p>
.
--fstrikethrough
````````````````````````````````


As with regular emphasis delimiters, a new paragraph will cause the cessation
of parsing a strike-through:

```````````````````````````````` example
This ~~has a

new paragraph~~.
.
<p>This ~~has a</p>
<p>new paragraph~~.</p>
.
--fstrikethrough
````````````````````````````````
